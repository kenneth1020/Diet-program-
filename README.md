# Diet-program-
Diet app program for Hackthon 2020. Sadly we never gotten to put our work together to make the app complete due to the time constant but had fun working with others 

# Description

This program was design to read a csv filed and used it data to provide the user a search opition on finding nutrient facts about the food. The user will go into through the interface looking for their product and typing its ID number. The ID number is the number in the array list. 

They call pull up that certain iteam and then calculated using pounds or ounces to add up their nutrients facts. Over the spam of the interface experience. When the user exit the system and done searchign with the program. It will show the nutients total intake.
